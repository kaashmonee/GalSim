- Creates a "galaxy" modeled by a circular gaussian profile.
- Convolve using Gaussian PSF
    * Why is this convolution done?
        - This is done to "blur" the image.
        - This allows for a more realistic model of the galaxy.
    * Adds Gaussian noise.
        - Why is the noise added Gaussian?
        - Want to simulate noise in a real image, but why Gaussian?
        - And how is it Gaussian? Gaussian w.r.t what? The center?
- Output was saved in output/demo1.fits.
- Was able to view the demo1.fits file using ds9 on Ubuntu 20.04.
- The demo1.yaml file provides information on the type of galaxy,
  the psf to use (if not convolved with anything, effective PSF is delta function),
- Image parameter specifies other information about the image like the pixel_scale,
  noise, including the type of noise (default is Gaussian), and sigma (std. dev. of counts in each pixel)
- Playing with noise parameter substantially increases the "graininess" of the image.
- Increasing gal_flux makes the image a lot softer and smoother. 
  Effectively increases the resolution.
