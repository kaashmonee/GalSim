- Still creating an image of a galaxy, but this time
  the galaxy has an exponential radial profile and is sheared.
  (Q1) What is an "exponential radial profile?"
  (Q2) How to shear a galaxy?
- PSF -> circular "Moffat" profile.
  (Q3) Why does the PSF use this "Moffat" profile?
- Noise is drawn from a Poisson distribution using flux from the
  object and the background sky to determine variance in each pixel.
  (Q5) Why Poisson noise?
- (Q4) What exactly is gal_flux?
  (A4) Seems like a parameter that roughly corresponds to pixel density/resolution.
- g1 and g2 are shear parameters.
- Modifying g1/increasing g1 results in a horizontal shear.
- Modifying g2/increasing g2 results in more of a diagonal shear, towards northeast corner.
- Was able to increase psf_beta up to 6 and for values after 6, resulted in error:


demo2.yaml:
- g1 and g2 means to use "reduced shear definition"
- (A3) A Moffat is a better approximation of ground based PSFs than Gaussians.
- (A5) Poisson noise models how noise normally happens on CCD images. However, note that most of the noise comes from sky flux.
