Main task:
- compare timing for photon shooting vs. DFT branches for various types of profiles.
(Q) What are these various types of profiles?

Comments:
- demo7 --- make full output, includes 4 realizations each for 5 different galaxy types
- make a table for typical times per galaxy for each combination of galaxy + PSF
- table -- has columns for:
	* galaxy type, 
	* PSF type, 
	* typical time for DFT per galaxy, 
	* typical time for photon shooting per galaxy
- get typical times for
	* galaxy type, PSF type, ratio of photon-shooting to DFT time

- At what S/N does photon shooting become faster than FFT?
- At low S/N, all galaxy types will be faster to drawShoot than to draw
- At high S/N, it's the opposite
- tabulate crossover point for a number of different profiles
- pixel size + image size could also affect relative timing 
	* start with Nyquist pixel size adn image size that is automatically chosen for the profile
		(Q) What the heck is the Nyquist pixel size?
		(Q) Include larger pixel scale values and both smaller and larger images to see 
	* include some larger pixel scale values and both smaller and larger images to see whether
	  and how much that affects relative timings.


Possible way to go about resolving this issue:
- add another method to drawImage called phot_auto that would work like phot in terms of noise 
  profiles
  	* (Q) where is drawImage written??
	* (Q) How does phot work?
	* (Q) What are these "noise profiles?"
- Once a heuristic is developed, use the heuristic to automatically switch to ffts and add 
  Poisson noise at the very end.


Notse on May 21, 2018 by rmjarvis on how to proceed:
- FFT timing should be proportional to the size of the K-space image.
	- can check with obj.drawFFT_makeKImage
	- returns a built k-space image along with a target real-space size (N)
	- break it up so just the bounds are returned rather than teh image so we can check
	  how many pixels it would be doing without the memory allocation
- Photon timing going to be proportional to the number of photons that need to be shot
- (normally the flux but not always)
	* (Q) When is it not the flux?
- Obtain t_fft/pixel and t_phot/photon for most classes
- Once we have these ratios, get n_pixels and n_photons and multiply by scaling factors to figure
  out which method will be faster

rmandelb direction to proceed, May 30, 2019
- For a single fixed galaxy and a PSF profile (e.g. a Sersic profile of a specific n, size, shape, 
  convolved with a Kolmogorov of a particular FWHM and shape, write the code needed to find 
  the quantities described by @rmjarvis. (t_fft/pixel and t_phot/photon)
- Decide on a list of parameters to vary for galaxy and PSF profiles to execute code from (1)
  in an informative set of scenarios
- Decide how to sample the space (grid or something more complicated...what does this mean?)
