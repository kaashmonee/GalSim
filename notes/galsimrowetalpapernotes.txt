ABSTRACT:
- Nothing particularly useful here.

Introduction:
- Simulations in GREAT08 challenge (bridle et al) showed
  impact of noise in a blind comparison of shear estimation
  methods.
- helped better characterize "noise biases..." not sure exactly
  what those are

Surface brightness profiles:

- Exponential disk profile (page 4):
    * provides a good description of the outer, star-forming
      regions of spiral galaxies
    * represented in GalSim by Exponential class

- de Vaucouleurs profile:
    * found to give a good fit to the light profiles of
      elliptical galaxies and the central bulge regions
      of galaxies that are still actively star-forming
    * have very cuspy cores and broad wings
        - cusp occurs around the size of the scale radius r0
    * represented in GalSim by DeVaucouleurs class
        - contains a truncation radius due to broadness of the
          wings

- sersic profile:
    * generalization of both exponential and de Vaucouleurs
      profiles
    * represented in GalSim with the "sersic" class

- Real Galaxies:
    * borne from high resolution observations made from the HST
      (hubble space telescope)
    * used as direct models of light profiles for simulations
    * represented in GalSim by the RealGalaxy class

- Airy & obscured airy profile
    * Diffraction patterns that we could add to a galaxy to
      obtain more realistic effects
    * complex aberrated wavefronts can be incident on a
      circular pupil
    * low order zernike polynomials map to low order aberrations
      found commonly in telescopes

- OpticalPSF class:
    * (Q) Not a 100% sure exactly how this works...
